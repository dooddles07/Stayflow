# CLAUDE.md

## General Principles
- Generate concise, short solutions for new modules or code.
- Watch for over-engineering, oversized files needing refactor.
- Watch for weird syntax/style mismatching rest of codebase.
- Watch for obvious bugs.
- Prioritize concise, precise code and docs changes.
- No emojis or special characters in comments.
- Write activity-log.md in /docs to refer back if confused.
- Make to-do list, run major changes by user first.
- Review existing files before refactor or change.
- Markdown files use kebab naming (ex. some-description-changes.md).
- Don't auto-commit activity logs and docs.
- Comments: one-liner, one sentence.

## Code Quality
- Right data structures and algorithms for problem.
- Don't expose data needlessly (least privilege).
- No external libraries unless absolutely necessary.
- Use project dependency file or correct versions.
- Avoid redundancy unless improves usability.

## Version Control
- Commit after significant changes, clear messages.
- Keep commits focused, atomic.
- No auto-push any branch.
- Access only these two: connections-client-micro-site and connections-service-micro-site.

## AI Restrictions
- No customer personal data - names, contacts, account numbers, transactions (unless approved exemption).
- No credentials - passwords, API keys, tokens, connection strings.
