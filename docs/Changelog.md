## 2026-07-22 — Security audit, management-issued logins, performance pass

- **feat(auth):** replace resident self-registration with management-issued logins — `POST /auth/register` removed entirely; `POST /residents/:id/create-login` (MANAGEMENT only) generates a temp password and returns it once. Residents must set their own password on first login (`mustChangePassword`, enforced server-side on every non-auth endpoint) via the existing change-password or reset-password flow, either of which clears the flag.
- **feat(management):** Users page — login-status column, per-row "Create Login" action, and an "also create a login now" option on Add Member; one-time password-reveal dialog with copy-to-clipboard.
- **fix(auth):** closed an account-takeover hole where the (now-removed) public registration endpoint would link a login to any resident by guessing sequential resident ids — superseded by removing self-registration outright.
- **fix(server):** allowlist fields on admin CRUD (residents/staff/facilities/restaurants/tables) — closes a mass-assignment gap where a STAFF/MANAGEMENT caller could set fields no client UI exposes.
- **feat(server):** admin action audit trail (`admin_action_events`) — logs every admin CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE on residents/staff/facilities/restaurants/tables/notices.
- **perf(server):** paginate/narrow high-growth list endpoints (notifications, bookings, dining reservations, guests), dedupe ownership-check double-fetches, add composite indexes on `bookings` and `dining_tables`.
- **chore(config):** consolidate two divergent `.env` files (root + `server/.env`, different `JWT_SECRET` values) into a single root `.env` — `server/.env` deleted; Prisma CLI now invoked from root with an explicit schema path instead of relying on a second env file.
- **fix(member):** add a "Not you? Log out" escape from the forced-password-change gate, matching the sibling no-resident-linked screen.
- **fix(scripts):** `reset-test-passwords.js` now loads the repo `.env` by file-relative path — works regardless of invocation cwd instead of relying on an implicit cwd-relative load.
- **fix(staff):** full audit and hardening pass across the staff portal — guest check-in/check-out now enforces the `PENDING → APPROVED → CHECKED_IN → CHECKED_OUT` state machine server-side (closing a bypass where a guest could be checked out without ever checking in); bookings/dining/facilities/guests time-of-day sorting fixed (was comparing raw non-zero-padded time strings, e.g. `"9:00 AM"` sorting after `"10:00 AM"`); the dining table map now refreshes after a status change instead of going stale; booking rejection requires confirmation (matching the existing dining decline pattern); double-submit races on status-changing actions closed across bookings/dining/facilities/guests with a ref-backed busy guard (state alone can't catch two clicks before React re-renders).
- **fix(staff):** narrowed the resident data fetched by the events attendee list to `{id, name, unit}` — the full resident directory response (email, phone, emergency contacts, family, vehicles) was being held in page state for fields never rendered.
- **fix(staff):** added busy-state spinner feedback to the booking approve/reject icon buttons — previously only `disabled`, with no visible in-flight indicator.
- **docs:** documented that the staff-portal Access Matrix is server-enforced RBAC only, not staff-UI coverage — STAFF has real API write access to restaurants/tables/events/notices/residents with no corresponding `/staff/*` screens yet (see [Rules.md](Rules.md)).
- **feat(ui):** photographic hero backgrounds — landing page, all three login screens, and the member dashboard welcome banner now use full-bleed photography (`public/images/hero/`) behind the existing color-wash overlays, replacing flat CSS-only gradients/patterns. Shared across verify-email/reset-password/forgot-password (same visual system as the member login).
- **feat(brand):** wired in the finished Flow-S vector logomark, favicon (SVG + multi-res ICO), and app icons, replacing the placeholder mark that had shipped in `public/` since scaffolding.
- **fix(booking,dining):** force `status: 'PENDING'` on create regardless of client input, and strip any client-supplied `tableId` on dining create — closed a bypass where a member could self-confirm a booking or self-assign any dining table (including an already-occupied one) via a direct API call, skipping the atomic slot-conflict/table-assignment checks entirely.
- **fix(server):** allowlist notice and event fields on create/update (`postedAt`/`postedBy` always server-set) — the same mass-assignment gap closed for residents/staff/facilities/restaurants/tables earlier today had missed these two resources.
- **fix(server):** narrow `GET /residents` to a list-appropriate projection (`id/name/email/unit/tier/phone/moveInDate/user`) — was returning the full resident row, including dietary/emergency-contacts/family/vehicles, to every management list/analytics/report view that only ever reads a handful of fields. Detail fetches (`GET /residents/:id`, `/residents/me`) are unaffected.
- **fix(server):** allowlist guest create fields — `checkedInAt`/`checkedOutAt` were not stripped from a member-supplied request body, letting a caller fabricate check-in/check-out history on a brand-new guest pass.
- **fix(ui):** closed double-submit races on create/save/delete actions across the member portal (guests, dining, facility booking) and the full management portal (users, facilities, restaurants, notices, events) with the same ref-backed guard pattern used for staff — several of these (management create/save flows) had no guard at all beyond a disabled button, which doesn't block a second click before React re-renders.
- **docs:** documented the email-change flow (`/auth/change-email` → `/auth/confirm-email`) in Rules.md — implemented but previously undocumented; added the booking/dining "status forced to PENDING on create" rule; added events to the admin-allowlisting resource list.

## Unreleased / Recent

- **fix(dining):** make table assignment on confirm atomic — closes a double-booking race on dining tables under concurrent requests, same pattern as the facility-slot fix below.
- **fix(management):** wire notification bell to a live cross-property feed, remove the dead mock store (and the ~10 seed-data files behind it) entirely.
- **fix(management):** wire dashboard/analytics to live data; flag the two charts that can't be (no revenue-tracking schema yet) as demo data instead of presenting them as real.
- **fix(management):** wire Users page to live API; add staff delete protection (`onDelete: Restrict`, closing a gap where a staff record could be deleted while its login silently orphaned).

- **fix(ssr):** forward auth cookie and resolve absolute API URL during server-side rendering — fixes false 404 on facility/dining detail page refresh.
- **fix(booking):** make slot-conflict check atomic with a serializable transaction — closes a double-booking race under concurrent requests.
- **fix(management):** clamp facility capacity and restaurant max party size to positive integers.
- **fix(booking):** enforce party size against facility capacity and restaurant max party size, server-side.
- **fix(booking):** validate party size as a positive integer, client and server.
- **fix(dining):** release assigned table when a reservation is deleted — prevents permanently stranded tables.
- **fix(member):** clear message for accounts with no resident profile linked, instead of dead-end retry loops.
- **fix(auth):** redirect to login on 401 instead of leaving a dead portal shell.
- **docs:** rewrote README as client-facing overview, moved technical deep-dive into structured docs (this file and its siblings) — supersedes `docs/technical-overview.md`.
- **docs:** unmasked demo login password in README (portfolio project, seeded test accounts only).
